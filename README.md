https://ctf.hackthebox.com/event/1386

## [Misc](./misc)

### Character
Difficulty: Very Easy

Security through Induced Boredom is a personal favourite approach of mine. Not as exciting as something like The Fray, but I love making it as tedious as possible to see my secrets, so you can only get one character at a time!

### Colored Squares
Difficulty: Medium

In the heart of an ancient forest stands a coloured towering tree, its branches adorned with countless doors. Each door, when opened, reveals a labyrinth of branching paths, leading to more doors beyond. As you venture deeper into the maze, the forest seems to come alive with whispered secrets and shifting shadows. With each door opened, the maze expands, presenting new choices and challenges at every turn. Can you understand what's going on and get out of this maze?

### Cubicle Riddle
Difficulty: Easy

Navigate the haunting riddles that echo through the forest, for the Cubicle Riddle is no ordinary obstacle. The answers you seek lie within the whispers of the ancient trees and the unseen forces that govern this mystical forest. Will your faction decipher the enigma and claim the knowledge concealed within this challenge, or will the forest consume those who dare to unravel its secrets? The fate of your faction rests in you.

### MultiDigilingual
Difficulty: Hard

It's a known secret that each faction speaks different languages, however few can speak all of them. KORP has long wanted to send a spy in the factions to keep an eye on them. Through their extensive network, they have found different talented factionless to test. The first to show their multidigilingual skills will get a place in them, and be their secret agent amongst the factions. Can you show them your worth?

### Path of Survival
Difficulty: Hard

Far off in the distance, you hear a howl. Your blood runs cold as you realise the Kara'ka-ran have been released - vicious animals tortured beyond all recognition, starved to provide a natural savagery. They will chase you until the ends of the earth; your only chance of survival lies in a fight. Strong but not stupid, they will back off if they see you take down some of their number - briefly, anyway...

### Quantum Conundrum
Difficulty: Medium

KORP™, the heartless corporation orchestrating our battles in The Fray, has pushed us to our limits. Refusing to be a pawn in their twisted game, I've learned of a factionless rebel alliance plotting to dismantle KORP™. While it may sound like mere whispers, there's a chance it holds truth. Rumors suggest they've concealed a vital communication system within The Fray, powered by cutting-edge quantum computing technology. Unfortunately, this system is reportedly malfunctioning. If I can restore this communication network, it could be the key to toppling KORP™ once and for all. However, my knowledge of quantum computing is limited. This is where you come in! As I infiltrate The Fray to access the system, I'll rely on your expertise to identify and repair the issue. Are you up for the challenge? Together, we can make a difference in this battle against oppression.

### Stop Drop and Roll
Difficulty: Very Easy

The Fray: The Video Game is one of the greatest hits of the last... well, we don't remember quite how long. Our "computers" these days can't run much more than that, and it has a tendency to get repetitive...

### Unbreakable
Difficulty: Easy

Think you can escape my grasp? Challenge accepted! I dare you to try and break free, but beware, it won't be easy. I'm ready for whatever tricks you have up your sleeve!

### Were Pickle Phreaks
Difficulty: Easy

The Phreaks have rolled a new registration app to recruit new members so they can help them grow and evolve. You, a factionless, see this and think of other plans...

### Were Pickle Phreaks Revenge
Difficulty: Medium

After you humiliated them, the Phreaks have changed their app to make it more secure. You won't make a fool of them again. Or will you?
